        Light pollution is an ever-growing problem in our modern world. Countless lights causing excessive air pollution, affecting human health and wasting energy in pretty much every big city. More than 20% of energy used for lighting is wasted due to inefficient lighting practices. In addition to that, more than 80% of the world’s population lives under light-polluted skies. The need for sustainable, efficient lighting solutions has never been more pressing.<br><br>
        Introducing GlowAura, our groundbreaking innovation is designed to address the issue of light pollution while providing practical and sustainable illumination. Glow Aura presents a luminescent powder that absorbs and stores natural light during the day, releasing a soft, radiant glow in the dark. Using photoluminescent pigments, like strontium aluminate, we create a storage for the collected sunlight. Mixed into a weather persistent street paint, we create a product that can be used outdoors and is environmentally friendly. This  product offers the alternative to traditional lighting methods, reducing the need for constant artificial light sources.<br><br>
        Imagine safer, well-lit pathways and beautifully illuminated urban spaces, all without the environmental impact of conventional lighting. Glow Aura transforms ordinary objects into sources of light that enhance visibility and add a touch of magic to any space.
